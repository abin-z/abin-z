- 👋 Hi, I'm Abin, a C++ software engineer.
- 👀 I’m interested in C++ / Rust / Python.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning  Rust, Boost libraries in C++, and working with CMake and vcpkg on Rocky Linux.
- 💪 Motto: Instead of lamenting the difficulty of the road, let's get going now!
- ⚡ Fun fact: We are making the world a better place, building perfect systems through code reuse and extension.
